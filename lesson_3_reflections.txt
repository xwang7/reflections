when would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when I work on another computer but still want to update my repository or other contributor want to update repository.


why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because sometimes updates are small or very trivial to my whole project.
I don't want to update every time but finished some milestone then manually update.

Describe the differences between forks,clones, and branches. when would you use one instead of another?
forks used for cloneing repository from other's repository to your github respository. clone used for clone repository from local to local or github to local. branches is used for make some tags.

What's the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
so you can compare difference and know what changes have been made remotely when you pull.

how would you collaborate without using Git or Github? and what would be easier, and what would be harder?
if without Git or Github we need to compare each code thoroughly and not easily to find the difference. Git will be easier.
