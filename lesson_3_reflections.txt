when would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when I work on another computer but still want to update my repository or other contributor want to update repository.


why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because sometimes updates are small or very trivial to my whole project.
I don't want to update every time but finished some milestone then manually update.
